## 🚀 Featured Projects (Focus on Impact and Decisions)

### 1. Reading Eye For Blind Using Raspberry Pi (KSCST-Funded Final Year Project)

> [cite_start]**Awarded Funding by KSCST**[cite: 15]. This is the most unique and valuable entry; emphasize it.

* [cite_start]**Goal:** To engineer a low-cost, portable assistive device for visually impaired individuals to convert physical printed text into clear audible speech[cite: 35].
* [cite_start]**Architecture:** Developed the core system on a **Raspberry Pi**[cite: 36]. The solution integrated a camera module and a Python-based processing pipeline.
* [cite_start]**Key Technical Challenge & Solution:** Managed real-time image capture and implemented an image-to-text pipeline using **OpenCV** for essential image preprocessing (e.g., perspective correction, noise reduction) and **Tesseract-OCR** for accurate character recognition[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]**Outcome:** Successfully integrated a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine[cite: 38]. **[Insert a quantitative metric, e.g., "Achieved an average processing time of < 5 seconds per text capture."]**
* [cite_start]**Tech Stack:** Raspberry Pi, Python, OpenCV, Tesseract-OCR, Text-to-Speech (TTS)[cite: 34].
